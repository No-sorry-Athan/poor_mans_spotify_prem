highkey scuffed coding cuz i was bored during quaratine and realized i was poor 8/8/2020
- uses send inputs to start the music again cuz i didnt know abt
reading from api and possibly changing it based on sending to spotify's api/
whatever
-extremely memory (?) inefficient
-like its constantly running which probably isnt the healthiest for
a computer
-probably should add a way to have it not run for a certain amt of time after
finding that its not playing an add
-maybe just sleep it for songs duration or smthing but idk im kinda lazy rn
-also alot of stuff is hard coded
-for it to work u gotta get an auth key so like if anyone else tryna use this
keep that in mind ig
